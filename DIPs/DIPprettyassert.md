## Abstract

Provides custom assert diagnostics.
Allow for assert to do pretty printing of its failing expression when flagged for in call to compiler. Printing is configurable via specific sets of (template) function overloads.

## Rationale

State a short motivation about the importance and benefits of the proposed
change.  An existing, well-known issue or a use case for an existing projects
can greatly increase the chances of the DIP being understood and carefully
evaluated.

## Description

Detailed technical description of the new semantics.
Language grammar changes (per https://dlang.org/spec/grammar.html)
needed to support the new syntax (or change) must be mentioned.

No grammar changes are required, but new overloads to D runtime are necessary.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

Provide a detailed analysis on how the proposed changes may affect existing
user code and a step-by-step explanation of the deprecation process which is
supposed to handle breakage in a non-intrusive manner. Changes that may break
user code and have no well-defined deprecation process have a minimal chance of
being approved.

### Examples

A more practical explanation of DIP semantics should be given by showing
several examples of its idiomatic application. Inspecting vivid code examples
is usually an easier & quicker way to evaluate the value of a proposal than
trying to reason about its abstract description.
